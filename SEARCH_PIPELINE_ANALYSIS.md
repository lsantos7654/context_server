# Search Pipeline Analysis & Issues

## Overview

Investigation into search pipeline issues reveals critical problems with semantic search and knowledge graph functionality. The system has the infrastructure in place but key components are misconfigured or not properly integrated.

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Semantic Search Failure** 🔍

**Problem**: "calendar" returns results but "calendar widget" returns 0 results despite both having valid embeddings.

**Root Cause**: Over-engineered query classification system with hardcoded rules incorrectly routes queries to specific search strategies instead of using a generalized hybrid approach.

**Evidence**:
- Direct embedding search works: `calendar widget` similarity score = 0.42
- CLI search returns 0 results for same query
- Query analysis shows: "calendar" → `GENERAL` type, "calendar widget" → `API_REFERENCE` type
- Strategy routing:
  - "calendar" uses: `['hybrid_search', 'semantic_search', 'multi_strategy_fusion']`
  - "calendar widget" uses: `['api_search', 'structured_search', 'multi_strategy_fusion']`

**Fundamental Issue**: The system uses hardcoded word lists and brittle classification logic instead of relying on vector similarity and hybrid search for all queries.

**Location**: `context_server/core/query_analysis.py`, `context_server/core/multi_modal_search.py`

### 2. **Knowledge Graph Empty** 🕸️

**Problem**: Knowledge graph insights always show "Total Relationships: 0" and no meaningful connections.

**Root Cause**: `KnowledgeGraphBuilder` is never called during document processing pipeline, and the graph structure doesn't properly represent the hierarchical nature of the data.

**Missing Graph Structure**: The knowledge graph should represent multiple node types:
- **Document nodes**: Raw files/URLs that were processed
- **Chunk nodes**: Text segments extracted from documents
- **Code block nodes**: Specific code segments identified within chunks
- **Relationships**: Semantic connections, containment hierarchies, and cross-references

**Evidence**:
- Database query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM content_relationships` returns 0
- Knowledge graph builder exists but is not integrated into document ingestion
- No relationships are built between documents, code sections, or related content
- Current design doesn't account for document → chunk → code block hierarchy

**Location**: Document processing pipeline missing knowledge graph integration

### 3. **Search Threshold Issues** ⚖️

**Problem**: Valid semantic matches are filtered out by overly restrictive similarity thresholds.

**Evidence**:
- Direct embedding search returns results with similarities 0.32-0.42
- These scores may be below strategy-specific thresholds
- Different strategies may have incompatible minimum similarity requirements

**Location**: Various search strategy implementations

## Technical Details

### Database State
```
Total chunk embeddings: 546
voyage-code-3: 476 embeddings (1024 dimensions)      ← Code-specific
text-embedding-3-small: 70 embeddings (1536 dimensions)  ← General content
Total relationships: 0
Context 'my-docs': 394 chunks, 442 embeddings
```

### Embedding Service Status
- ✅ OpenAI embeddings working (1536 dimensions)
- ✅ Voyage Code embeddings available and previously used (1024 dimensions)
- ✅ Content-aware routing: Code content (>30%) → Voyage Code, General → OpenAI
- ✅ Intelligent fallback: Voyage fails → OpenAI Small

### Search Strategy Issues
```python
# Current problematic classification
"calendar" → QueryType.GENERAL → semantic_search + hybrid_search ✅
"calendar widget" → QueryType.API_REFERENCE → api_search + structured_search ❌
```

## Design Principles for Fixes

### Core Philosophy: Simplicity and Generalization

1. **No Hardcoded Classifications**: Remove all hardcoded word lists, programming language detection, and framework-specific logic
2. **Hybrid-First Approach**: Use vector similarity + keyword search for all queries by default
3. **LLM-Based Extraction**: When metadata extraction is needed, use LLM calls rather than regex patterns
4. **Hierarchical Graph Structure**: Model the natural document → chunk → code block hierarchy
5. **Null-Tolerant**: All extraction processes should gracefully handle null/empty results

## Proposed Course of Action

### Phase 1: Simplify Search Strategy (High Priority)

**Goal**: Replace complex query classification with a simple, reliable hybrid search approach.

**Tasks**:
1. **Remove QueryAnalyzer complexity**
   - Remove hardcoded programming language lists
   - Remove keyword-based query type classification
   - Remove strategy routing based on query analysis
   - Keep only basic query preprocessing (tokenization, normalization)

2. **Implement multi-embedding unified search strategy**
   - Search both embedding spaces simultaneously (Voyage Code + OpenAI)
   - Use content-aware query embedding (code-related → Voyage, general → OpenAI)
   - Perform weighted fusion of results from both embedding spaces
   - Remove specialized search strategies (api_search, structured_search, etc.)
   - Always attempt multi-vector hybrid search for all queries

3. **Replace hardcoded metadata extraction with LLM calls**
   - Use LLM to extract keywords from content when needed
   - Use LLM to identify programming languages (with null as valid result)
   - Use LLM to extract code elements and API references

**Files to modify**:
- `context_server/core/query_analysis.py` (simplify drastically)
- `context_server/core/multi_modal_search.py` (remove complex strategy selection)
- `context_server/core/content_analysis.py` (add LLM-based extraction)

### Phase 2: Build Hierarchical Knowledge Graph (High Priority)

**Goal**: Create a proper graph structure representing document → chunk → code block hierarchy with semantic relationships.

**Tasks**:
1. **Define hierarchical node structure**
   - Document nodes: Raw files/URLs with metadata
   - Chunk nodes: Text segments with embedding vectors
   - Code block nodes: Extracted code segments with syntax metadata
   - Relationship types: CONTAINS, REFERENCES, SIMILAR_TO, IMPLEMENTS

2. **Integrate graph building into processing pipeline**
   - Create nodes during document ingestion
   - Build containment relationships (document → chunks → code blocks)
   - Use embeddings to find semantic similarity relationships
   - Extract cross-references using LLM analysis

3. **Implement intelligent graph-based search enhancement**
   - Automatically include high-confidence relationships (similarity > 0.8)
   - When search finds tutorial chunks, auto-surface related code blocks
   - When search finds code, auto-include parent document context
   - Provide rich metadata showing available related nodes without overwhelming
   - Enable zero-parameter intelligence: users get smart results without specifying what they want

**Files to modify**:
- `context_server/core/enhanced_processing.py`
- `context_server/core/relationship_mapping.py` (redesign for hierarchy)
- `context_server/api/documents.py`
- Database schema for hierarchical relationships

### Phase 3: Optimize Search Thresholds (Medium Priority)

**Goal**: Ensure valid results aren't filtered out by overly restrictive thresholds.

**Tasks**:
1. **Review and adjust similarity thresholds**
   - Lower minimum similarity thresholds in search strategies
   - Make thresholds configurable
   - Implement adaptive thresholds based on query analysis

2. **Add search result debugging**
   - Log threshold decisions
   - Add verbose mode showing filtered results
   - Implement search quality metrics

**Files to modify**:
- `context_server/core/multi_modal_search.py` (all search strategy methods)
- `context_server/core/enhanced_storage.py` (search methods)

### Phase 4: Enhanced Search Features (Low Priority)

**Goal**: Improve overall search experience and capabilities.

**Tasks**:
1. **Add intelligent result enhancement**
   - Provide rich metadata for discoverability
   - Show connection reasoning: "Also found: calendar example code (same document)"
   - Surface high-confidence relationships automatically
   - Enable power user flags: --expand-graph, --show-relationships

2. **Implement search analytics**
   - Track query patterns
   - Measure search effectiveness
   - Optimize strategy selection

3. **Add context expansion improvements**
   - Better boundary detection
   - Smarter expansion logic
   - Integration with knowledge graph

- Verify embedding storage and retrieval efficiency

## Success Criteria

1. **Simplified Search**: All queries use hybrid approach by default, no misclassification
2. **Consistent Results**: "calendar", "calendar widget", "widget" all return relevant results
3. **Hierarchical Graph**: Knowledge graph shows document → chunk → code block relationships
4. **Context Retrieval**: Can find tutorial text and retrieve related code blocks via graph traversal
5. **LLM Integration**: Metadata extraction uses LLM calls instead of hardcoded patterns
6. **Performance**: Search latency remains under 5 seconds, graph traversal under 2 seconds

## Example Success Scenario

**Query**: "calendar widget"

**Expected Result**:
```
Result 1: Calendar Widget Tutorial (OpenAI embedding match)
├── Content: "The calendar widget allows you to display dates..."
├── Related Code: calendar.rs (89% match, auto-included)
├── Same Document: 2 more code examples
└── Metadata: {code_blocks: 3, similar_docs: 2, parent: "ratatui-widgets.md"}

Result 2: Calendar Implementation (Voyage Code embedding match)  
├── Content: "fn render_calendar(area: Rect, buf: &mut Buffer) { ... }"
├── Parent Context: Widget Tutorial (full explanation, auto-included)
├── Usage Examples: 3 different calendar setups
└── Metadata: {explanation_chunks: 1, examples: 3, references: ["list", "table"]}
```

**Key Features Demonstrated**:
- Multi-embedding search finds both tutorial AND code automatically
- Zero-parameter intelligence: user didn't specify they wanted both
- Rich metadata shows what else is available for exploration
- Graph traversal provides context without overwhelming

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Query classification fixes (well-contained changes)
- Threshold adjustments (easily reversible)

### Medium Risk
- Knowledge graph integration (new processing overhead)
- Search strategy modifications (could affect existing functionality)

### Mitigation
- Implement feature flags for new functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Add comprehensive testing before deployment
- Monitor performance metrics during rollout

## Next Steps

1. **Create detailed implementation plan** for Phase 1 fixes
2. **Set up testing environment** for validation
3. **Begin with QueryAnalyzer modifications** as highest impact, lowest risk change
4. **Establish metrics and monitoring** for search quality assessment
