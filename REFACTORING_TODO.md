## Implementation Guidelines

### Before Starting
1. **Always activate virtual environment**: `source .venv/bin/activate`
2. **Follow CLAUDE.md**: Reference @CLAUDE.md for coding standards
3. **Write tests first**: Ensure behavior doesn't change during refactoring

### Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Start development
source .venv/bin/activate
make up                    # Start services

# 2. Make changes following CLAUDE.md standards
# 3. Test changes
make test                  # Run tests
make quality-check         # Format, lint, test

# 4. After completing tasks
pre-commit run --all-files # Fix all issues
make test                  # Verify no regressions
```

### Priority Execution Order

2. Remove Redis infrastructure
3. Fix import paths and type hints

**Phase 2 - Duplication Elimination (High Priority)**
1. Extract shared utilities
2. Create error handling decorators
3. Standardize CLI patterns

**Phase 3 - Testing Infrastructure (High Priority)**
1. Set up test frameworks
2. Write comprehensive test suites
3. Ensure all functionality is covered

**Phase 4 - Architecture Improvements (Medium Priority)**
1. Implement repository pattern
2. Add structured logging
3. Create custom exceptions

**Phase 5 - Polish & Performance (Low Priority)**
1. Performance monitoring
2. Final optimizations
3. Documentation updates

## Notes

- **Redis Removal**: Confirmed Redis is not used in code, safe to remove from infrastructure
- **Legacy src/ Directory**: Contains 1000+ lines of outdated code that needs removal
- **Type Hints**: Audit found extensive use of `typing.Dict/List` instead of `dict/list`
- **Code Duplication**: 6 major patterns identified affecting 200-300 lines
- **File Cleanup**: 500+ files can be safely deleted

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Reduce codebase complexity by 500+ files
- [ ] Eliminate 300+ lines of duplicated code
- [ ] Achieve 90%+ test coverage
- [ ] All pre-commit hooks pass
- [ ] Zero linting/type checking errors
- [ ] All TODO comments resolved
