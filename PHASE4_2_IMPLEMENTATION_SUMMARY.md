## ðŸ”§ Key Technical Innovations

### 1. Multi-Strategy Question Analysis
```python
async def _analyze_question(self, question: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Detect question type using pattern matching
    question_type = "general"
    for q_type, patterns in self.question_patterns.items():
        for pattern in patterns:
            if re.search(pattern, question_lower):
                question_type = q_type
                break

    # Extract entities and determine intent
    entities = self._extract_entities(question)
    intent = intent_map.get(question_type, "informational")

    return {
        "type": question_type,
        "intent": intent,
        "entities": entities,
        "requires_code": question_type in ["how_to", "code_example", "troubleshooting"]
    }
```

### 2. Intelligent Content Retrieval
```python
async def _find_relevant_content(self, question, question_embedding, context_id, question_analysis, limit):
    # Strategy 1: Semantic similarity search
    semantic_results = await self.database_manager.semantic_search(
        query_embedding=question_embedding, context_id=context_id, limit=limit // 2
    )

    # Strategy 2: Entity-based keyword search
    keyword_results = []
    for entity in question_analysis["entities"][:3]:
        entity_results = await self.database_manager.keyword_search(
            query=entity, context_id=context_id, limit=5
        )
        keyword_results.extend(entity_results)

    # Strategy 3: Content type specific search
    if question_analysis["type"] in ["how_to", "code_example"]:
        type_results = await self.database_manager.search_by_content_type(
            content_types=["tutorial", "code_example"], context_id=context_id
        )
```

### 3. Knowledge Graph Enhanced Context
```python
async def _enhance_with_relationships(self, content, knowledge_graph, intent):
    for item in content:
        url = item.get("url")
        related_content = []

        for relationship in knowledge_graph.relationships:
            if relationship.source_url == url:
                if intent == "procedural" and relationship.relationship_type == RelationshipType.TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE:
                    related_content.append({
                        "url": relationship.target_url,
                        "relationship": "next_step",
                        "strength": relationship.strength
                    })

        item["related_content"] = related_content
```

### 4. Adaptive Learning Path Construction
```python
async def _build_learning_path(self, recommendations, knowledge_graph, user_level):
    # Separate content by type and difficulty
    tutorials = [rec for rec in recommendations if rec.recommendation_type == "tutorial"]
    examples = [rec for rec in recommendations if rec.recommendation_type == "example"]

    learning_path = []

    # Start with beginner tutorials if user is beginner
    if user_level == "beginner":
        beginner_tutorials = [t for t in tutorials if t.difficulty_level == "beginner"]
        learning_path.extend([t.url for t in beginner_tutorials[:2]])

    # Use knowledge graph to order based on tutorial sequences
    ordered_path = self._order_path_by_relationships(learning_path, knowledge_graph)
    return ordered_path[:10]
```

### 5. Context-Aware Answer Synthesis
```python
async def _synthesize_answer(self, question, content_texts, question_analysis):
    question_type = question_analysis["type"]

    if question_type == "how_to":
        return f"""Based on the available documentation, here's how to approach this:

{self._extract_procedural_info(content_texts)}

This approach is derived from the relevant documentation in your context."""

    elif question_type == "troubleshooting":
        return f"""Here are solutions based on the troubleshooting information in your context:

{self._extract_solution_info(content_texts)}

These solutions are from the documentation and examples in your workspace."""
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Question Type Analysis Matrix

| Question Type | Intent | Detection Patterns | Answer Strategy | Content Preference |

| **How-to** | Procedural | `how (do i\|to\|can i)`, `steps to`, `way to` | Step extraction | Tutorial, Code Example |
| **What-is** | Definitional | `what is`, `define`, `explain`, `meaning of` | Definition synthesis | Concept Explanation, Reference |
| **Troubleshooting** | Problem-solving | `error`, `not working`, `problem`, `fix` | Solution extraction | Troubleshooting, Reference |
| **Code Example** | Implementation | `example of`, `sample code`, `implementation` | Code-focused | Code Example, Tutorial |
| **Comparison** | Analytical | `difference between`, `vs`, `compare` | Comparison analysis | Reference, Concept Explanation |

    relevant_content, knowledge_graph, question_analysis["intent"]
)

# Learning path using tutorial sequences
ordered_path = self._order_path_by_relationships(learning_path, knowledge_graph)
```

### With Enhanced Database Layer
```python
# Multi-strategy content search
semantic_results = await self.database_manager.semantic_search(...)
keyword_results = await self.database_manager.keyword_search(...)
type_results = await self.database_manager.search_by_content_type(...)
```

### With Multi-Embedding Service
```python

question_embedding = await self.embedding_service.embed_single(
    question, content_analysis=None
)
```

## ðŸ§ª Usage Examples

### Question-Answering
```python
from context_server.core.llm_endpoints import LLMOptimizedEndpoints

endpoints = LLMOptimizedEndpoints(embedding_service, database_manager, knowledge_graph_builder)

# Answer a how-to question
answer = await endpoints.answer_question(
    question="How do I create a Python function?",
    context_id="my_context",
    max_sources=5,
    include_code=True
)

print(f"Answer: {answer.answer}")
print(f"Confidence: {answer.confidence}")
print(f"Sources: {len(answer.supporting_sources)}")
print(f"Code Examples: {len(answer.code_examples)}")
print(f"Follow-ups: {answer.follow_up_questions}")
```

# Get learning recommendations
recommendations = await endpoints.recommend_context(
    user_query="I want to learn web development with React",
    context_id="my_context",
    user_level="beginner",
    max_recommendations=10
)

print(f"Primary Recommendations: {len(recommendations.primary_recommendations)}")
print(f"Learning Path: {len(recommendations.learning_path)} steps")
print(f"Knowledge Gaps: {recommendations.knowledge_gaps}")
print(f"Next Steps: {recommendations.next_steps}")

# Explore individual recommendations
for rec in recommendations.primary_recommendations:
    print(f"- {rec.title} ({rec.recommendation_type})")
    print(f"  Relevance: {rec.relevance_score:.2f}")
    print(f"  Why: {rec.why_recommended}")
```

### Answer Analysis
```python
# Analyze question characteristics
question_analysis = await endpoints._analyze_question(
    "What's the difference between Python and JavaScript?"
)

print(f"Type: {question_analysis['type']}")           # comparison
print(f"Intent: {question_analysis['intent']}")       # analytical
print(f"Entities: {question_analysis['entities']}")   # ['python', 'javascript']
print(f"Requires Code: {question_analysis['requires_code']}")  # False
```
